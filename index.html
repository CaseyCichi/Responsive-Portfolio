            <p>My name is Casey Poon, and I am currently 20 years old and studying at Miramar College. When I first got out of highschool I had a very different vision of what I wanted versus what I want today. I started studying graphic arts and design and did lots of free lance work including packaging and logo designing.</p>

            <p>I took buisness classes for a year and a half, and realized that I really didn't enjoy it. I am currently studying informatics/computer science, and although im only just getting my feet wet, I really enjoy it!

<!-- For the Responsive Portfolio assignment, I think I struggled a lot with fixing the layout once I used the media queries. The areas that I failed to complete were the portfolio sections. I was not able to make the media query cooperate with the photos and how they were being laid out. The absolute boxes on top of the photos were not sticking and when I moved them around, they were being really funky. I attempted to try different things but didn't seem to work. Another area that I thought. Another thing that I had trouble fixing was the main body section and how it went all the way to the bottom and touched the footer. Lastly, I was unable to make the scrolling of the screen, therefore, some of the contact box is hidden and unable to see unless you open the browser bigger. Overall, I think this assingment was much more difficult than the last assingment and wish I were able to produce a more mobile responsive website.  -->
